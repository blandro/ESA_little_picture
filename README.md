# ESA_little_picture

Just my small journey to create a submission for the annual ESA little picture competition. It is supposed to be a simple and illustrative design, yet beeing able to be informative with just a few words to guide.

My contribution shows the water vapour to air ratio in the atmosphere in the unit moles/mole. Measurements shown are yearly averages from 1985 to 2019.
